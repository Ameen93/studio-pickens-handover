- **Image Upload**: < 5 seconds for 10MB files  
- **Admin Panel Load**: < 3 seconds initial load
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for normal operations
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Document for Users)

1. **No Edit Functionality** - Most components only support add/delete
2. **Manual Positioning** - Story editor requires CSS knowledge
3. **No Undo/Redo** - Changes are immediately saved
4. **Single User** - No multi-user editing support
5. **File-Based Storage** - Limited scalability compared to database

---

**Status**: üü° FUNCTIONAL BUT NEEDS SECURITY HARDENING
**Next Actions**: Fix critical security issues identified, implement authentication
**Estimated Completion**: Ready for development/testing, needs security work for production

## üìã TESTING COMPLETION SUMMARY

‚úÖ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:**
- Complete admin panel functionality testing
- All API endpoints verified working
- Image management system fully functional
- Frontend-backend integration working
- Data persistence confirmed
- TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- Comprehensive .gitignore created
- Live preview system working
- All CRUD operations functional

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
- No authentication/authorization system
- Loose equality bugs in delete operations  
- CORS allows all origins
- Hardcoded localhost URLs need environment config
- File-based storage has scalability limits

üî¥ **SECURITY PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:**
1. Implement admin authentication
2. ‚úÖ Fix loose equality comparisons (server.js lines 126, 159) - **COMPLETED**
3. ‚úÖ Add environment-based configuration - **COMPLETED**
4. Restrict CORS to production domains

The system is **fully functional for development and testing** but requires security hardening before production deployment.
